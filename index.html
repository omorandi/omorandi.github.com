  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tip may be useful to iOS developers when they&#8217;re given a bunch of high-resolution files and they need to rename them with the <strong><em>@2x</em></strong> filename suffix.</p>

<p>Supposing the files are all in the same directory (containing only the files you need to rename), just do this in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>for file in *; do mv "$file" "${file%.*}@2x.${file##*.}"; done
</code></pre>

<p>As a result, the files will all be renamed following the pattern <code>&lt;name&gt;@2x.&lt;extension&gt;</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Short answer is: &#8220;YES&#8221; (at least on iOS - for now), and this post is here to share some very early results for supporting such statement. What&#8217;s reported here is just something I started working on in the last few weeks and it&#8217;s still a quite long term work in progress.</p>

<h2>Profiling tools</h2>

<p>Profiling means measuring how much time is spent in every relevant portion of code of an application during its execution, and it represents the first step to be done when searching for spots in the code that can be optimized, in order to achieve better performance. Performing any form of optimization without profiling first is like running a race with blinded eyes.</p>

<p>So, what does it mean profiling a Titanium Mobile application written in JavaScript? What tools do we have? How can we find hotspots in our poorly behaving apps? The reality is that unlike other development enviroments, the Titanium Mobile SDK doesn&#8217;t provide any tool for accurately profiling JS apps.
When developing for iOS, we can use the Instruments profiling tool provided with Xcode, and the typical results obtained using such tool are shown in the following picture:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/XcodeProfilingTool.png"></p>

<p>in the bottom-right panel we see a list of functions and methods with the associated total time spent executing them. However, while this kind of information gives us a notion on the time spent inside the functions of the framework, the time spent in our JavaScript functions, which are those we probably want to optimize, is completely hidden behind the calls to the functions of the JavaScript interpreter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, developers coming from web development may be used to working with the JS tools provided by the major browsers (e.g. Firebug in Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari developer tools, etc.), which give us detailed profiling information on the scripts being executed by a web page. For example, the following picture shows the results obtained with the developer tools available with Chrome:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/ChromeProfiling.png"></p>

<h2>Profiling Ti apps</h2>

<p>Since I need to profile a quite complex Titanium Mobile application for finding hotspots in the code that may need to be offloaded to some native modules, I started guessing how could I achieve my goal. As usual, digging into the Ti SDK code helps a lot, and after following the white rabbit in the hole I found the response in the code of the JavaScriptCore interpreter. We always have to remember that Titanium Mobile shares its core engines with Safari and Chrome, i.e. JavaScriptCore and V8 respectively, so any low level feature tied to JS execution available in these browsers is also available in Titanium, moreover all that code is completely available as open source. So, it turns out that most of the features needed for profiling JS code are exactly where they should be, i.e. in the interpreter.</p>

<p>For those who wonder how a profiler works, it&#8217;s easy told. The profiler is nothing more than a component that records the time when each function gets called and when it returns. Whenever the interpreter needs to execute a function, it tells the profiler: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to execute function F, which starts at line X of file at URL Y&#8221;. The same just after the execution of the function: &#8220;I executed Function F, bla bla&#8221;. This allows the profiler to have a clear vision on two very important kinds of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>How function calls are related, i.e. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graph</a></li>
<li>How much time is spent during the execution of every function</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the total time spent in a function will also include the time spent in nested function calls, but the profiler keeps track of these situations, in order to give accurate results.</p>

<p>So, during my journey, I managed to <a href="/2012-03-02-building-titanium-mobile-jscore-from-source">build the JavaScriptCore library from scratch</a> and I started tweaking the code in order to be able to start and stop the profiling from the native code of a Titanium application. I had a quite encouraging success a couple of weeks ago and tweeted about it:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>YAY! got JSCore profiler running in Ti Mobile on iOS! Still work to be done for extracting useful info, though - <a href="https://t.co/yXtItEwS" title="https://skitch.com/omorandi/8ggw7/xcode">skitch.com/omorandi/8ggw7…</a></p>&mdash; Olivier Morandi (@olivier_morandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/olivier_morandi/status/175231374662443010" data-datetime="2012-03-01T14:49:50+00:00">March 1, 2012</a></blockquote>


<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Actually I was happy about the integration, but no real profiling data was returned. After studying more deeply the code and a lot of debugging, today I&#8217;ve been able to produce a  more meaningful profile of a test application, which is composed of a barebone <code>app.js</code> file:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2029449.js?file=app.js"></script>


<p>and a module containing a couple of functions performing some useless math tasks. The module is suitable to be either included via <code>Ti.include()</code>, or required through CommonJS <code>require()</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2029449.js?file=included.js"></script>


<p>Please note that the two test functions in <code>included.js</code> are defined in different ways. The first is defined as a <strong>named function</strong> <code>test1()</code>, while the other is defined as an <strong>anonymous function</strong>, which is assigned to the variable <code>test2</code>.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s have a look at what results we have in the Xcode console when I run this program with Ti 2.0.0 and my modified version of the TiJSCore library (click on the image to see it at full size with annotations):</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/JSCProfiling-include-annotated.png"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/JSCProfiling-include.png"></a></p>

<p>What gets printed in the console log is the call graph of the program, recorded during its execution. Indentation reflects the caller->called hierarchy and the reported information includes (if available) the file containing the called function, the line where the function is defined the name of the function (more on this later) and the time statistics in terms of &#8220;Total Time&#8221; spent in the function and &#8220;Self Time&#8221;, which is given by the &#8220;Total Time&#8221; for the function minus the time spent in nested calls.</p>

<p>In the call graph, some calls are reported with <code>&lt;nofile&gt;</code> file information. These are mainly native and host functions (e.g. <code>Math.cos()</code>, <code>Math.sin()</code>, <code>Ti.include()</code>, and <code>Ti.API.info()</code>), for which no source file is given. Moreover, the calls reported to <code>(program)</code> are those happening in the global scope, while those reported as <code>(Function object)</code> are those made to native and host functions. Similarly, the calls reported as <code>(anonymous function)</code> are obviously those made to anonymous functions. So, depending on how a program is structured it may be more or less easy to interpret such profiling information. For instance, in my apps, a good 90% of the functions are anonymous.</p>

<h2>How did I make it?</h2>

<p>As I told, this is still work in progress and all I have profiled until now is some very basic test application like the one reported here. For achieving these early results I had to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extend a bit the TiJSCore library, in order to expose a couple of functions to the Ti SDK, which are used for starting and stopping the profiler.</li>
<li>Perform some very small modifications to the interpreter in order to enable code instrumentation (i.e. the code that&#8217;s used for generating profile data)</li>
<li>Modify the iOS application template generated by the Ti SDK, in order to start the profiler when the first JS execution context is created, and stop the profiling when the application goes in background (e.g. because the user presses the home button), printing the profiling report as a result</li>
</ol>


<p>All this isn&#8217;t usable yet for profiling &#8220;any&#8221; real world application, since most of the steps required still need to be done by hand (i.e. patching the Ti SDK and so on), so I think I&#8217;ll wait until the thing is a bit more stable before publishing the code.</p>

<h2>Future steps</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s missing? A lot of things, here are some:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking out what happens with event listeners and callbacks</li>
<li>Test with more complex applications</li>
<li>Creating install scripts in order to streamline the operation on existing applications</li>
<li>Move code for starting and stopping the profiling out of the Ti SDK and put it in a module</li>
<li>Enable the possiblity to start and stop the profiling and analyzing results from a front-end cli app</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s it. If anyone is interested in more details don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I already mentioned <a href="http://titaniumninja.com/post/10559549700/fastdev-for-ios-how-it-works/">here</a>, the Titanium Mobile framework on iOS is based on <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore">JavaScriptCore</a> (i.e. the engine used by WebKit) for interpreting and executing your app&#8217;s JS files.</p>

<p>Since part of my everyday work consists in hacking with the Ti SDK internals and building native modules it often happens that I need to track a bug or an issue down inside the core functions of the framework, and sometimes it would be useful to just take a look at the internal state of the JavaScript engine, in order to have a more detailed vision on where the problem at hand comes from.</p>

<p>However, the JSCore library (<code>libTiCore.a</code>) shipped with the Titanium SDK, is built in <em>Release</em> mode, with debug symbols stripped out, so, while its method and function names appear in a debug stack trace, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to look at actual variable and class member values.</p>

<p>Fortunately the source code of the library, customized by Appcelerator for integrating it with Titanium, is <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/tijscore">available on github</a>, so we can create a custom build of it (e.g. a Debug version) and use it for our purposes.</p>

<p>Historically, building the library from scratch has not been much simple, nor documented. Moreover, since the process relied on several shell scripts, it was quite easy to get lost (at least at a first glance). However, in the last few months both Stephen Tramer and Blain Hamon (who are the main contributors to that code base) made a great work in simplifying and linearizing the build process.</p>

<p>This post aims at being just a quick tutorial for anyone needing to build <code>libTiCore</code> from scratch, so let&#8217;s dig in.</p>

<h2>Building the libTiCore.a library</h2>

<p>As usual, we can pull the git repo with:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/appcelerator/tijscore.git
</code></pre>

<p>Once downloaded, in the <code>tijscore</code> directory we&#8217;ll find a couple of scripts, namely <code>fixup.py</code> and <code>buildit.sh</code> and the <code>TiCore</code> directory, which contains the original files from the JSCore sources.</p>

<p>In order to build the library we first need to run:</p>

<pre><code>./fixup.py
</code></pre>

<p>This script will patch most of the files in the TiCore directory, by changing names of files and symbols according to the Titanium namespace <strong>Ti</strong>, which is the one expected by the Ti SDK source code.</p>

<p>Then we can go with</p>

<pre><code>./buildit.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This script will build the library and create a universal binary for the armv6, armv7 and i386 architectues. The build process is quite long (a bunch of minutes on my i7 MacBook Pro) and you&#8217;ll notice it&#8217;s completed when you hear the cooling fans of your computer stop whirling like crazy.</p>

<p>The <code>buildit.sh</code> script also accepts a <em>CONFIG</em> parameter that we can use for instructing it to build a debug version of the library:</p>

<pre><code>./buildit.sh Debug
</code></pre>

<p>Once the build process is completed you&#8217;ll find the <code>libTiCore.a</code> library binary in the <code>TiCore/build</code> directory. The last required step is to install it in the appropriate folder of the Ti SDK:</p>

<pre><code>cp TiCore/build/libTiCore.a $TITANIUM_DIR/mobilesdk/osx/$TITANIUM_VERSION/iphone/
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>$TITANIUM_DIR</code> and <code>$TITANIUM_VERSION</code> are respectively the root directory of your Ti SDK and the version you are currently using, e.g. <code>/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium</code> and</p>

<h2>A note on libTiCore.a versions vs Ti SDK versions</h2>

<p>The Titanium Mobile SDK and the TiCore library are not really independent, so you must pay really big attention on which version of the library versus which version of the SDK you use, otherwise you will quite surely incur in linking errors when you build your titanium applications. For instance, this short tutorial is proved to work with version 16 (git hash ad8053020d) of the library,  which is used by the version 2.0.0 of the Ti SDK.</p>

<p>For 1.8.X versions of the Ti SDK you should use version 15 of the library by checking out the git tag named <code>TiCore-15</code> in the <code>tijscore</code> repository, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout TiCore-15
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Testing mobile apps in the target platform simulator (either iOS or Android) can often be misleading, since the provided environment is an ideal one. The result is that an app working perfectly when executed in an emulated sandbox may expose unintended behaviors and perfomance when executed in open field on a real device. Moreover, not only physical resources, like processor performance and available memory are very different: also the characteristics of the  network connection available to a development machine (i.e. wifi attached to a DSL or better link) usually outperform those of the mobile Internet links available in the wild, usually ranging from no connection at all to different kinds of 3G connections.</p>

<p>Several techniques do exist for simulating more realistic network characteristics when testing mobile apps on OS X, however most of them leverage the <em>traffic shaping</em> capabilities of the <code>ipfw</code> builtin firewall. In particular, they use the <code>ipfw pipe</code> command, which allows to define a pipe where all or part of the network traffic originating from, or directed to the host will be forced into.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the pipe can be shaped according to specific requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay and packet-loss-ratio of the link that needs to be modeled, thus enabling a high flexibility. A pipe can be configured through the following command:</p>

<pre><code>ipfw pipe &lt;num&gt; config bw &lt;bw&gt; delay &lt;d&gt; plr &lt;plr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>num</code> is a number identifying the pipe, <code>bw</code> the desired bandwidth measured in <code>[K|M]{bit/s|Byte/s}</code>, <code>delay</code> is the propagation delay measured in milliseconds, and <code>plr</code> is the packet-loss-ratio, i.e. a number in the range [0..1].</p>

<p>The following adds a firewall rule for the pipe:</p>

<pre><code>ipfw add &lt;rule-num&gt; pipe &lt;num&gt; &lt;protocol&gt; from &lt;src&gt; to &lt;dst&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The meaning of the command is the following:</p>

<pre><code>* add rule with number rule-num
* get all the packets containing protocol and directed from src to dst
* flow them through the pipe identified by num
</code></pre>

<p>For example, modeling a GPRS link could be done with:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 56Kbit/s delay 200 plr 0.2
sudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 ip from any to any
</code></pre>

<p>which forces all the ip traffic through a 56Kbps link with a 200ms delay, which loses 20 packets out of 100 in average.</p>

<p>It should be noted that while the rule is enforced, <strong>all</strong> the network traffic generated from or directed to the host machine is affected. Once the testing has been performed, the rule can be deleted with the command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ipfw delete 1
</code></pre>

<p>Not all network links have symmetric characteristics. In those cases it&#8217;s possible to model in a different way the uplink and the downlink sections with the following rules:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ipfw pipe 1 config bw 780Kbps delay 100
sudo ipfw pipe 2 config bw 330Kbps delay 100
sudo ipfw add 1 pipe 1 in proto ip
sudo ipfw add 1 pipe 2 out proto ip
</code></pre>

<p>More details can be found in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man8/ipfw.8.html">ipfw man page</a> and in the original <a href="http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/dummynet/">Dummynet project</a> page.</p>

<p>Using this technique from the command line, while effective, is probably not much practical. Moreover, figuring out realistic values for the required parameters can be a quite difficult task. A help in overcoming these issues comes from the developer tools available with XCode 4.2 on OS X Lion that, among others, provide a system preference pane called &#8220;Network Link Conditioner&#8221;, which allows to perform the same operations I listed before through a simple GUI, with a lot of predefined configuration templates.</p>

<p>The tool can be found here:</p>

<pre><code>/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Network\ Link\ Conditioner/Network Link Conditioner.prefPane
</code></pre>

<p>and once installed is made available in the System Preferences:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/NetConditionerSysPref.png"></p>

<p>The panel allows selecting a configuration from a list of presets, which comprise different kinds of mobile and &#8220;home&#8221; network links:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/NetConditioner.png"></p>

<p>The desired settings can be activated through the big switch present on the left of the panel and, in case the available presets are not sufficient, it&#8217;s possible to define custom configurations through the &#8220;Manage Profiles&#8221; button:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some days ago I <a href="http://titaniumninja.com/post/10360108035/titanium-hack-fastdev-for-ios">published</a> a hack that allows patching the Titanium Mobile SDK for enabling fast on-device testing of iOS applications, without needing to rebuild, sign and redeploy them.</p>



<p>With this post I&#8217;d like to share some of the inner workings of the Titanium sdk that make that hack possible. I also try to explain in more detail how the hack works, so you may want to check out its source code at <a href="https://github.com/omorandi/TiiOSFastDev"><a href="https://github.com/omorandi/TiiOSFastDev">https://github.com/omorandi/TiiOSFastDev</a></a>.</p>



<p>First, I need to say that, in contrast to what many developers believe when they first approach Titanium Mobile, the JavaScript files that compose an application are not compiled to native code. Instead they get interpreted by a JavaScript engine: a slightly modified version of <a href="http://">JavaScriptCore</a> on iOS (i.e. the engine used by WebKit), and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> (which will be hopefully soon replaced by  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a>) on Android.</p>



<p>When deploying an application on the iOS emulator, the JS engine gets fed directly with the original files that reside in the <code>Resources</code> directory of your app project, loaded at runtime. This allows you for example to see the changes you made in one file, by just restarting the app in the emulator.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when deploying on the device, the original source files are processed and packed into a single file, just before building the app. 

This step generates the <code>build/iphone/Classes/ApplicationRouting.m</code> file, which is one of the very few that are dynamically generated by the build process. Indeed, most of the objective-c files that compose the native app are simply copied from the appropriate Ti SDK directory (e.g. <code>/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0</code>) into the <code>build/iphone</code> directory of the project by the titanium build scripts when you launch the app from Ti Studio, or from the command line.</p>



<p>Once generated, <code>ApplicationRouting.m</code> contains the definition of a dictionary object that associates the name of each JS file present in the Resources directory of your project with a binary representation of its original content, along with a single class method named <code>resolveAppAsset:</code> whose only purpose is to return the appropriate file content for a given path:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/1237812.js?file=gistfile1.m"></script><p>In other words, this portion of code represents the point where the original content of each JS file is dispatched to the Titanium runtime environment, which will then feed it to the JSCore interpreter.</p>



<p>As you surely understand at this point, the FastDev hack is made possible by simply using a modified version of the <code>resolveAppAsset</code> method, which, instead of returning static data, opens a connection to an HTTP server running on the development machine for retrieving the original JS files from the Resources directory:</p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/1237725.js?file=gistfile1.m"></script><p>Actually it&#8217;s that simple, however there are some caveats:</p>



<ol><li><p>Since the method is called synchronously, also the HTTP request must be performed in a synchrounous way:</p>



<p><code>[request startSynchronous];</code></p></li>

<li><p>For testing the application on the iOS emulator, the request to the server can be made on <code>localhost</code>, however, for on-device testing, we need to know in advance the IP address at which we the server can be reached, because the modified <code>ApplicationRouting.m</code> will be built into the native application running on the target device. This is achieved through a simple trick in the startserver.py script:</p></li>

</ol><script src="https://gist.github.com/1237809.js?file=gistfile1.py"></script><p>This code allows discovering the local IP address that routes to the Internet (specifically to gmail.com), so I make the assumption that the iPhone/iPad used for testing and the development machine reside both on the same local network and that the IP address of the Mac machine on that network is also the one that routes it to the Internet.</p>



<p>So the <code>startserver.py</code> script uses this information for patching the <code>build/iphone/Classes/ServerAddr.h</code> file containing  the <code>SERVER_ADDRESS</code> define, which is used in <code>ApplicationRouting.m</code> for creating the HTTP request. This is also why the <code>startserver.py</code> script needs to be launched before building the app.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
