I’m Olivier Morandi, a software engineer working as a freelance consultant from the North-Western italian Alps.

Even if I spent a good part of the last decade doing [academic research](http://netgroup.polito.it/Members/olivier_morandi) on technologies for high-speed network processing, during the last few years I've reinvented myself as a mobile developer, and I've been involved in several projects based on Titanium Mobile, either developing and maintaining mobile apps, or hacking with internals of the framework, extending it and creating native modules.

I am also a <a href="/tcad">Titanium Certified App Developer</a> (TCAD) and <a href="/tcmd">Titanium Certified Mobile Developer</a> (TCMD).

You can find some of my open source projects on [github](https://github.com/omorandi).

If you need help for developing/refactoring a Titanium Mobile app, or for creating custom native modules, don’t hesitate to contact me.
