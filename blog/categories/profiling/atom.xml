    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around four months ago I started experimenting with some <a href="http://titaniumninja.com/profiling-ti-mobile-apps-is-it-possible/">custom modifications</a> to the  JavaScriptCore library, which is the JavaScript engine used by the Titanium Mobile SDK for executing Titanium applications on iOS. After succeeding in enabling the profiler component provided by JSCore and extracting some relevant profiling data from running applications, I wanted a tool that would allow me to show such information in a manageable way, like the Web Inspector and Developer tools allow to do in Safari or Chrome.</p>

<p>My basic requirements were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tool needed to be able to start and stop the profiler running alongside a Titanium Mobile application executed on the iOS Simulator, as well as to retrieve the collected profiling data</li>
<li>The GUI app should be very simple and quick and easy to develop: a web app would be good enough</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to show the profiling data (i.e. a function call tree showing the amount of time spent in each function) in the typical expandable tree grid</li>
<li>I wanted to be able to quickly show the source code of every referenced function, in order to better understand the data every time an anonymous function was reported</li>
</ul>


<p>So I started creating a very simple web-based GUI and a node.js server component providing a proxy between the client app and the profiler, and today I'm able to introduce some results, with the following demo screencast:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/46148981" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/46148981">TiProfiler demo</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user8368459">Olivier Morandi</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></center>


<p>This has been possible thanks to the following technologies/libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">Ext JS</a>: General GUI layout &amp; tree-grid</li>
<li><a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ACE editor</a>: for showing the original source code of the selected application files</li>
<li><a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a>: for event-based communication between all the components</li>
</ul>


<p>The screencast showcases the usage of the three main components involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>The node-based server, used for serving the client app files and for communicating  with both the profiler and the GUI</li>
<li>The GUI app itself</li>
<li>The Titanium Mobile application, built and executed through a custom version of the 2.1.0.GA Titanium SDK, with all the required additions to make the magic possible</li>
</ul>


<p>The node server gets notified when the Titanium application and the profiler are started, re-broadcasting such events.
The web-app, on the other side, issues start &amp; stop commands to the node server, which reflects them to the profiler running inside of the Ti app.</p>

<p>At the core of the system lies a custom version of the TiJSCore library, and some very limited additions to the inner workings of the Titanium Kroll bridge. In particular, besides the basic modifications already mentioned in the <a href="http://titaniumninja.com/profiling-ti-mobile-apps-is-it-possible">previous post</a>, it has been necessary to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>modifying the code managing the CommonJS <code>require()</code> function, in order to make both the JS interpreter and the profiler aware of the names of the files being loaded through it</li>
<li>decorating the calls to methods of Titanium proxy objects with a representation of their real name, in order to highlight them with something more meaningful than <code>(Function oject)</code>. For example a call to <code>Ti.UI.Window.open()</code> now it's reported as <code>[object TiUIWindow].open</code>: not exactly the JavaScript signature, but quite similar, indeed</li>
<li>building a bit of infrastructure in order to allow the profiler to communicate remotely, either for receiving <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> commands, either for sending the recorded profiling data. Using the <a href="https://github.com/pkyeck/socket.IO-objc">iOS port of the socket.io library</a> helped a lot in this context.</li>
<li>other minor adjustments (e.g. converting profiling data returned by the JSCore profiler to JSon)</li>
</ul>


<p>At the moment I'm not planning to release these modifications and additions as open source. I'm still thinking about what to do about them. Actually it would be nice if at some point they could be integrated into the Titanium SDK.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm willing to share this tool with the Titanium community, letting interested folks to play with it, and report any kind of feedback, so I've created a <a href="https://github.com/omorandi/TiProfiler">repository on github</a> hosting both the node server and the client app source code.</p>

<p>Originally I was aiming to keep all the modifications to the JSCore library, as well as the corresponding hooks inside the Titanium SDK completely self-contained in a single binary, in order to be able to provide just a simple drop-in replacement for the <code>libTiCore.a</code> library, to be plugged in a standard distribution of the Ti SDK. However, after integrating <code>socket.io</code> on the iOS side, things are a bit more complicated, since <code>socket.io</code> requires the target app to be linked with the Security framework, which is not linked by default in the standard Titanium Xcode template. For this reason, in order to keep things super-simple for anyone interested in this project, I've prepared a package containing a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titaniumninja/tiprofiler/2.1.0.GA-profiler.zip">custom version of the 2.1.0.GA Titanium SDK</a> that can coexist side by side with the official SDKs provided by Appcelerator already present in the system.</p>

<p>Anybody wanting to follow all the steps, without using the prebuilt package, can download a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titaniumninja/tiprofiler/libTiCore.a.zip">custom build of the libTiCore.a library</a>, copy it in the <code>${TI_SDK}/iphone</code> directory of a 2.X.X version of the Ti SDK (where <code>${TI_SDK}</code> for example is <code>/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.0.GA</code>, open the <code>${TI_SDK}/iphone/iphone/Titanium.xcodeproj</code>) and add there a reference to the Security framework.</p>

<p>The custom SDK can be used for building, executing and profiling any Titanium application on iOS, with the following, and maybe more, limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't work for Android targets</li>
<li>It can be used only with apps running inside the iOS Simulator:  apps should be able to execute on device, but at the moment, no profiling data can be exchanged with the node.js server component. Results of building and running Ti apps on device with such SDK are currently undefined</li>
<li>The client app is currently very limited</li>
</ul>


<h2>Wrap up</h2>

<p>Where do we go from here?</p>

<p>I have a bunch of things I'd like to improve/work on in the very near future. Here are some:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace the currently very limited web-app with the client from the <a href="https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector/">Node Inspector</a> project. This is actually a fork of the WebKit Web Inspector that can be used to debug and experimentally profile node.js applications. Modifying this to work with my server should be fairly easy</li>
<li>Improve the way in which anonymous functions are reported. It is true that these functions are actually unnamed, but in most cases they're usually referenced through a variable or an object member. I'd like to leverage the features of the super-cool <a href="http://esprima.org/">Esprima</a> JavaScript parser in order to extract such information directly from source files, reporting the name of the referencing variable/member when possible</li>
<li>Make things work on device</li>
<li>Start studying how to do something similar on V8 for android targets</li>
</ul>


<p>Any comment is well accepted, either here, or on <a href="http://twitter.com/olivier_morandi">twitter</a>. This project is needing some love, especially on the GUI component and node server side. Feel free to fork it on github and make pull requests.</p>

    <id>http://titaniumninja.com/profiling-ti-mobile-apps-is-it-possible</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Short answer is: "YES" (at least on iOS - for now), and this post is here to share some very early results for supporting such statement. What's reported here is just something I started working on in the last few weeks and it's still a quite long term work in progress.</p>

<h2>Profiling tools</h2>

<p>Profiling means measuring how much time is spent in every relevant portion of code of an application during its execution, and it represents the first step to be done when searching for spots in the code that can be optimized, in order to achieve better performance. Performing any form of optimization without profiling first is like running a race with blinded eyes.</p>

<p>So, what does it mean profiling a Titanium Mobile application written in JavaScript? What tools do we have? How can we find hotspots in our poorly behaving apps? The reality is that unlike other development enviroments, the Titanium Mobile SDK doesn't provide any tool for accurately profiling JS apps.
When developing for iOS, we can use the Instruments profiling tool provided with Xcode, and the typical results obtained using such tool are shown in the following picture:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/XcodeProfilingTool.png"></p>

<p>in the bottom-right panel we see a list of functions and methods with the associated total time spent executing them. However, while this kind of information gives us a notion on the time spent inside the functions of the framework, the time spent in our JavaScript functions, which are those we probably want to optimize, is completely hidden behind the calls to the functions of the JavaScript interpreter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, developers coming from web development may be used to working with the JS tools provided by the major browsers (e.g. Firebug in Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari developer tools, etc.), which give us detailed profiling information on the scripts being executed by a web page. For example, the following picture shows the results obtained with the developer tools available with Chrome:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/ChromeProfiling.png"></p>

<h2>Profiling Ti apps</h2>

<p>Since I need to profile a quite complex Titanium Mobile application for finding hotspots in the code that may need to be offloaded to some native modules, I started guessing how could I achieve my goal. As usual, digging into the Ti SDK code helps a lot, and after following the white rabbit in the hole I found the response in the code of the JavaScriptCore interpreter. We always have to remember that Titanium Mobile shares its core engines with Safari and Chrome, i.e. JavaScriptCore and V8 respectively, so any low level feature tied to JS execution available in these browsers is also available in Titanium, moreover all that code is completely available as open source. So, it turns out that most of the features needed for profiling JS code are exactly where they should be, i.e. in the interpreter.</p>

<p>For those who wonder how a profiler works, it's easy told. The profiler is nothing more than a component that records the time when each function gets called and when it returns. Whenever the interpreter needs to execute a function, it tells the profiler: "I'm going to execute function F, which starts at line X of file at URL Y". The same just after the execution of the function: "I executed Function F, bla bla". This allows the profiler to have a clear vision on two very important kinds of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>How function calls are related, i.e. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graph</a></li>
<li>How much time is spent during the execution of every function</li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously, the total time spent in a function will also include the time spent in nested function calls, but the profiler keeps track of these situations, in order to give accurate results.</p>

<p>So, during my journey, I managed to <a href="/2012-03-02-building-titanium-mobile-jscore-from-source">build the JavaScriptCore library from scratch</a> and I started tweaking the code in order to be able to start and stop the profiling from the native code of a Titanium application. I had a quite encouraging success a couple of weeks ago and tweeted about it:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>YAY! got JSCore profiler running in Ti Mobile on iOS!

<p>Actually I was happy about the integration, but no real profiling data was returned. After studying more deeply the code and a lot of debugging, today I've been able to produce a  more meaningful profile of a test application, which is composed of a barebone <code>app.js</code> file:</p>

<p>``` javascript app.js
Ti.include('included.js');</p>

<p>function launch_test1() {</p>

<pre><code>test1();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function launch_test2() {</p>

<pre><code>test2();
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>launch_test1();
launch_test2();
```</p>

<p>and a module containing a couple of functions performing some useless math tasks. The module is suitable to be either included via <code>Ti.include()</code>, or required through CommonJS <code>require()</code>:</p>

<p>``` javascript included.js
var exports = exports || {};</p>

<p>function test1() {</p>

<pre><code>var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {
    sum = sum + Math.cos(i);
}
Ti.API.info('result 1: ' + sum);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>var test2 = function() {</p>

<pre><code>var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {
    sum += Math.sin(i/1000);
}
Ti.API.info('result 2: ' + sum);
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>exports.test1 = test1;
exports.test2 = test2;
```</p>

<p>Please note that the two test functions in <code>included.js</code> are defined in different ways. The first is defined as a <strong>named function</strong> <code>test1()</code>, while the other is defined as an <strong>anonymous function</strong>, which is assigned to the variable <code>test2</code>.</p>

<p>Now let's have a look at what results we have in the Xcode console when I run this program with Ti 2.0.0 and my modified version of the TiJSCore library (click on the image to see it at full size with annotations):</p>

<p><a href="http://titaniumninja.com/images/posts/JSCProfiling-include-annotated.png"><img class="center" src="/images/posts/JSCProfiling-include.png"></a></p>

<p>What gets printed in the console log is the call graph of the program, recorded during its execution. Indentation reflects the caller->called hierarchy and the reported information includes (if available) the file containing the called function, the line where the function is defined the name of the function (more on this later) and the time statistics in terms of "Total Time" spent in the function and "Self Time", which is given by the "Total Time" for the function minus the time spent in nested calls.</p>

<p>In the call graph, some calls are reported with <code>&lt;nofile&gt;</code> file information. These are mainly native and host functions (e.g. <code>Math.cos()</code>, <code>Math.sin()</code>, <code>Ti.include()</code>, and <code>Ti.API.info()</code>), for which no source file is given. Moreover, the calls reported to <code>(program)</code> are those happening in the global scope, while those reported as <code>(Function object)</code> are those made to native and host functions. Similarly, the calls reported as <code>(anonymous function)</code> are obviously those made to anonymous functions. So, depending on how a program is structured it may be more or less easy to interpret such profiling information. For instance, in my apps, a good 90% of the functions are anonymous.</p>

<h2>How did I make it?</h2>

<p>As I told, this is still work in progress and all I have profiled until now is some very basic test application like the one reported here. For achieving these early results I had to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extend a bit the TiJSCore library, in order to expose a couple of functions to the Ti SDK, which are used for starting and stopping the profiler.</li>
<li>Perform some very small modifications to the interpreter in order to enable code instrumentation (i.e. the code that's used for generating profile data)</li>
<li>Modify the iOS application template generated by the Ti SDK, in order to start the profiler when the first JS execution context is created, and stop the profiling when the application goes in background (e.g. because the user presses the home button), printing the profiling report as a result</li>
</ol>


<p>All this isn't usable yet for profiling "any" real world application, since most of the steps required still need to be done by hand (i.e. patching the Ti SDK and so on), so I think I'll wait until the thing is a bit more stable before publishing the code.</p>

<h2>Future steps</h2>

<p>What's missing? A lot of things, here are some:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking out what happens with event listeners and callbacks</li>
<li>Test with more complex applications</li>
<li>Creating install scripts in order to streamline the operation on existing applications</li>
<li>Move code for starting and stopping the profiling out of the Ti SDK and put it in a module</li>
<li>Enable the possiblity to start and stop the profiling and analyzing results from a front-end cli app</li>
</ul>


<p>That's it. If anyone is interested in more details don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
